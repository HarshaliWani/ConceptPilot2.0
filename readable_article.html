    <h1>Post-software and pre-burnout</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">A readable version of your pasted article content.</p>

    <p>There’s a phrase, “Do as I say, not as I do.” Perhaps you’ve heard of it. It means people in positions of power, like parents, bosses, teachers, and political leaders, often tell us to do one thing while they do something entirely different.</p>
    <p>There’s a word for such behaviour: hypocrisy. Saying one thing, but doing another.</p>
    <p>My favourite versions of this phrase are its non-identical twins. Like, “Observe what customers do, not what they say,” or “Show, don’t tell.”</p>
    <p>Essentially, our actions reveal far more about reality than our words ever can. The same holds true for AI.</p>
    <p>For most of this week, we had global tech and AI leaders visit India’s AI Impact Summit, telling us exactly what we wanted to hear:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>“India is going to have an extraordinary trajectory with AI” – Google’s <a href="https://x.com/sundarpichai/status/2024089988221309140">Sundar Pichai</a></li>
      <li>India could evolve to become a “full-stack AI leader” – OpenAI’s <a href="https://www.storyboard18.com/digital/sam-altman-recasts-india-as-full-stack-ai-leader-ahead-of-india-ai-impact-summit-89772.htm">Sam Altman</a></li>
      <li>“India has led the way to show what is possible with the confluence of ambition and imagination” – Adobe’s <a href="https://www.digit.in/features/general/india-ai-impact-summit-2026-kicks-off-what-global-tech-leaders-are-saying.html#:~:text=Adobe's%20Chairman%20and%20CEO%20Shantanu,calling%20it%20%E2%80%9Cvisionary%20leadership.%E2%80%9D">Shantanu Narayen</a></li>
      <li>“India isn’t just participating in the global AI conversation, it’s helping shape what comes next.” – Qualcomm’s <a href="https://www.digit.in/features/general/india-ai-impact-summit-2026-kicks-off-what-global-tech-leaders-are-saying.html#:~:text=Qualcomm%E2%80%99s%20CEO%20Cristiano%20Amon%20sent%20a%20video%20message%20to%20the%20summit%E2%80%99s%20team%2C%20saying%20that%20he%20is%20excited%20to%20be%20a%20part%20of%20the%20event.%20He%20added%20%E2%80%9CIndia%20isn%E2%80%99t%20just%20participating%20in%20the%20global%20AI%20conversation%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20helping%20shape%20what%20comes%20next.%E2%80%9D%C2%A0">Cristiano Amon</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>You get my point, don’t you?</p>
    <p>Lately, I’ve taken to discounting what people say about AI, instead looking closely at what they actually do. And this past week, I saw two key trends emerge—“post-software” organisation, and within it, “pre-burnout” professional.</p>
    <p>Let’s start with the post-software organisation.</p>
    <p>It’s becoming clear that AI-assisted programming isn’t merely compressing earlier paradigms of software development, but completely rewriting them.</p>
    <p>Scratch that. It’s asking agents to reimagine them!</p>
    <p>Consider the concept of “dark factories”. Here’s an example of how even the phrase “writing software” is turning meaningless right before our eyes.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>At level 5, it’s not really a car any more. You’re not really running anybody else’s software any more. And your software process isn’t really a software process any more. It’s a black box that turns specs into software.</p>
      <p>Why Dark? Maybe you’ve heard of the Fanuc Dark Factory, the robot factory staffed by robots. It’s dark, because it’s a place where humans are neither needed nor welcome.</p>
      <p>I know a handful of people who are doing this. They’re small teams, less than five people. And what they’re doing is nearly unbelievable—and it will likely be our future.</p>
      <p><strong>The Five Levels: from Spicy Autocomplete to the Dark Factory</strong> by <a href="https://www.danshapiro.com/blog/2026/01/the-five-levels-from-spicy-autocomplete-to-the-software-factory/">Dan Shapiro</a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>If you’re thinking that this is speculative, go read about a startup called StrongDM AI that is doing exactly that. In fact, they claim that their <a href="https://factory.strongdm.ai/">two rules</a> of building software are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Code <strong>must not be</strong> written by humans</li>
      <li>Code <strong>must not be</strong> reviewed by humans</li>
    </ul>
    <p><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/7/software-factory/">Simon Willison</a> has a good explanation of just how bonkers and novel this approach really is.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>I visited the StrongDM AI team back in October as part of a small group of invited guests.</p>
      <p>The three person team of Justin McCarthy, Jay Taylor and Navan Chauhan had formed just three months earlier, and they already had working demos of their coding agent harness, their Digital Twin Universe clones of half a dozen services and a swarm of simulated test agents running through scenarios. And this was prior to the Opus 4.5/GPT 5.2 releases that made agentic coding significantly more reliable a month after those demos.</p>
      <p>It felt like a glimpse of one potential future of software development, where software engineers move from building the code to building and then semi-monitoring the systems that build the code. The Dark Factory.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>Just as I was wrapping my head around the idea of humans neither writing nor reviewing code, I came across Gas Town, a new “vibe coding orchestrator” from longtime software developer and writer Steve Yegge.</p>
    <p>What’s a vibe coding orchestrator, you ask? Here’s <a href="https://steve-yegge.medium.com/welcome-to-gas-town-4f25ee16dd04">Yegge’s explanation</a>.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Gas Town is an industrialized coding factory manned by superintelligent robot chimps, and when they feel like it, they can wreck your shit in an instant. They will wreck the other chimps, the workstations, the customers. They’ll rip your face off if you aren’t already an experienced chimp-wrangler. So no. If you have any doubt whatsoever, then you can’t use it.</p>
      <p>Working effectively in Gas Town involves committing to vibe coding. Work becomes fluid, an uncountable substance that you sling around freely, like slopping shiny fish into wooden barrels at the docks. Most work gets done; some work gets lost. Fish fall out of the barrel. Some escape back to sea, or get stepped on. More fish will come. The focus is throughput: creation and correction at the speed of thought.</p>
      <p>Work in Gas Town can be chaotic and sloppy, which is how it got its name. Some bugs get fixed 2 or 3 times, and someone has to pick the winner. Other fixes get lost. Designs go missing and need to be redone. It doesn’t matter, because you are churning forward relentlessly on huge, huge piles of work, which Gas Town is both generating and consuming. You might not be 100% efficient, but you are flying.</p>
      <p>In Gas Town, you let Claude Code do its thing. You are a Product Manager, and Gas Town is an Idea Compiler. You just make up features, design them, file the implementation plans, and then sling the work around to your polecats and crew. Opus 4.5 can handle any reasonably sized task, so your job is to make tasks for it. That’s it.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>Now, I am not arguing that this <em>is</em> the future of software engineering. Heck, it feels wrong to even call it “engineering” anymore. Instead, I am merely trying to understand what people are already doing.</p>
    <p>You get the sense that something deeper, something more structural, is changing. This feels different from recent (hyped) tech waves like blockchains and crypto.</p>
    <p>As Matt Schumer said in his massively <a href="https://shumer.dev/something-big-is-happening">viral post</a>, “Something big is happening.”</p>
    <p>Closer to home, engineers that I deeply respect and trust are saying <a href="https://nadh.in/blog/code-is-cheap/">something similar</a>.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>At this point, for a hands-on developer, reading and critically evaluating code have become more important than learning syntax and typing it out line by line. Of course, that is still an important skill, because the ability to read code effectively comes from that in the first place. But, the daily software development workflows have flipped over completely.</p>
      <p>An experienced developer who can <em>talk</em> well, that is, imagine, articulate, define problem statements, architect and engineer, has a massive advantage over someone who cannot, more disproportionately than ever. Knowledge of specific language, syntax, and frameworks is no longer a bottleneck. The physiological constraints of yore are no longer impediments. The machinery for instantly creating code at scale is now a commodity and available to everyone, just a <a href="https://nadh.in/blog/on-powered-by-ai-marketing/#no-you-are-not-missing-out">pip install equivalent</a> away. It requires no special training, no new language or framework to learn, and has practically no entry barriers—just good old critical thinking and foundational human skills, and competence to run the machinery.</p>
      <p>Conventional software development methodologies and roles—Waterfall to Agile, developer to tester, senior to junior—have fundamentally changed with traditional boundaries consolidating into unimaginably fast, compressed, blurry, iterative “agentic” loops. The dynamics of people, organisations, and public communities in software development, the very human incentives for sharing and collaboration, are all changing.</p>
      <p>For the first time ever, good talk is exponentially more valuable than good code. The ramifications of this are significant and disruptive. This time, it is <a href="https://nadh.in/blog/this-time-it-feels-different/">different</a>.</p>

    <p>Observing and understanding what’s happening with organisations is great, but ultimately, organisations are composed of people—at least until we have an all-agent organisation, which, based on current trends, might be just a few weeks or months away!</p>
    <p>So, what’s happening to the earliest and most eager adopters of AI? Well, some of them are starting to display early signs of burnout. From just doing <em>too much</em>.</p>
    <p>Coincidentally, Steve Yegge has another pertinent post on this again. He argues, convincingly, that using AI continuously <a href="https://steve-yegge.medium.com/the-ai-vampire-eda6e4f07163">drains our energy</a>.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>It would seem that we are addicted to a new drug, and we don’t understand all of its effects yet. But one of them is massive fatigue, every day.</p>
      <p>I don’t think that’s… good. And if anything, it seems to be getting more widespread. The developing situation is a multi-whammy coming at developers from all sides:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Crazy addicted early adopters are controlling the narrative.</li>
        <li>You can’t stop reading about it in the news.</li>
        <li>Panicking CEOs are leaning in hard to AI.</li>
        <li>Companies often don’t know how to ease up.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>So you’re damned if you do (you’ll be drained) and you’re damned if you don’t (you’ll be left behind.)</p>

    <p>Even <em>Harvard Business Review</em> is saying the same.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>In an eight-month study, researchers found AI tools didn’t reduce work; they intensified it. Employees worked faster, took on broader tasks, and extended work into more hours of the day, often voluntarily.</p>
      <p>The resulting workload creep can lead to cognitive fatigue, burnout, and weaker decision-making over time.</p>

    <h2>This week on the Zero Shot podcast</h2>
    <p>Hi! This is Vidhatri, the producer of <em>Zero Shot</em>. Every week, we aim to bring you a story about the Indian AI space that goes beneath the surface, something that is insightful yet critical. This week’s episode delivers on all those fronts.</p>
    <p>Voice AI is the talk of the town. Funding in the space has shot up from Rs 7 crore in 2023 to Rs 280 crore in 2025. Everyone wants to build in this space, convinced that India’s AI opportunity lies in voice.</p>
    <p>But what is the actual story?</p>
    <p>To find out, <em>The Ken’s</em> AI reporter, Mrunmayee Kulkarni, followed the money and spoke with founders, VCs, and other key stakeholders in the voice AI ecosystem. Her findings: the space is overcrowded. Two questions arise: Can the market sustain every player? And more importantly, how will they differentiate when everyone is picking the same battle?</p>
    <p>On this week’s <em>Zero Shot</em>, the team invited Mrunmayee to take listeners behind the scenes of her <a href="https://the-ken.com/story/voice-ai-has-gone-from-whisper-to-commotion-can-the-market-get-any-louder/?utm_source=web&utm_medium=homepage&utm_campaign=horizontal_layout_Spotlight">story</a>.</p>
    <p>Also joining was Devyani Gupta, the CEO of Arrowhead, a fast-growing AI startup that raised $3 million last month and counts the Aditya Birla Group and Paytm among its clients.</p>
    <p>Devyani described the competition as a “land grab market”. Everyone can build voice demos, but very few can deploy them in production.</p>
    <p>Bonus: They unpack what makes a voice bot more human.</p>
